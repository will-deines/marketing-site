# Configuration for "Small Team, Big Impact: Customer Support Strategies for Lean DTC Operations" Hero Image
# Creative concept: David vs Goliath in customer support

PROMPT="Dynamic illustration showing a small, agile support team (3-4 people) efficiently serving customers versus a large, bureaucratic support department in the background. The small team is depicted with streamlined workflows, direct connections to customers, and multi-skilled versatility - showing one person handling chat, phone, and email simultaneously. In contrast, the large team shows complex hierarchies and slow processes. Visual metaphors include efficiency arrows, streamlined communication lines, and satisfied customer icons. The small team glows with energy and connection, while customers flow naturally toward them. Color palette: Energetic oranges and blues for the small team, muted grays for the large organization. Modern, clean illustration style with clear visual storytelling. No text overlays."
