# Scene 1: The Spiral of Overwhelm (0-20s)
SCENE_1="A minimalist line-art figure of a founder sits centered in frame. Around them, an ever-expanding spiral of message bubbles, email icons, and question marks begins to form. The spiral spins increasingly faster, the figure shrinks as they're overwhelmed. Color palette starts with muted grays, gradually adding stress-inducing red tones. The chaos builds with overlapping notification sounds creating a cacophony."

# Scene 2: The Moment of Pause (20-25s)
SCENE_2="Everything suddenly freezes in complete silence. The figure slowly looks up. A single purple dot appears above them, pulsing gently with a clear bell chime. The figure takes a deep breath, represented by their outline expanding slightly."

# Scene 3: The Transformation (25-50s)
SCENE_3="The purple dot expands into flowing shapes that sweep through the chaos like gentle hands. Message bubbles transform into purple butterflies that flutter away. Email icons dissolve into sparkles. The gray environment transforms as purple and indigo gradients flow in like watercolor. Crystalline transformation sounds accompany each change."

# Scene 4: The Creative Space (50-70s)
SCENE_4="The founder now stands in an open, peaceful space with purple-indigo gradient background. They begin sketching and creating. Their creations bloom into life - dress designs materialize, product concepts take shape, business ideas manifest as golden light particles. Each creation is accompanied by organic sounds - pencil sketching, fabric rustling."

# Scene 5: The Connected Community (70-85s)
SCENE_5="Camera pulls back to reveal multiple founders in their own creative spaces, each working on their dreams. Flowing purple lines connect them, forming a constellation of creators. Their individual creations bloom outward, interweaving to create a beautiful tapestry of entrepreneurship."

# Scene 6: The Message (85-120s)
SCENE_6="Elegant typography fades in: 'Build the brand you always dreamed of'. The Garrio wordmark appears with tagline 'Your team is ready'. A soft call-to-action 'Start free today' gently pulses. The music resolves to a peaceful, accomplished tone. A final satisfied exhale as the screen fades to the brand's gradient."
