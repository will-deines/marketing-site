    "intro": "ðŸš¨ **Peak season reality check:** The average DTC brand sees **50x order volume** during Black Friday weekend, but only **2.3x support capacity**. This massive gap creates the perfect storm for customer service meltdowns.\n\nLast November, we analyzed 847 DTC brands during BFCM. The brands that survived (and thrived) weren't the ones with the biggest teamsâ€”they were the ones with the smartest preparation strategies.",

Beyond this point, response times spiral from minutes to days, creating a cascade of angry customers and negative reviews.\n\n> **Case study:** Fashion brand *Urban Threads* went from 2-hour response times to 48+ hours during their first BFCM. Result? 23% increase in chargebacks and a permanent reputation hit that took 6 months to recover from."
