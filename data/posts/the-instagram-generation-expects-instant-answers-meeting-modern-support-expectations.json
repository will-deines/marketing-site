    "intro": "📱 **The expectation shift:** 73% of Gen Z customers expect responses within 5 minutes, while traditional support averages 24 hours.\n\nThe Instagram generation didn't grow up waiting. They've never known a world without instant gratification—instant messages, instant photos, instant everything. When they shop your DTC brand, they bring those same expectations to customer support.\n\nIgnoring this shift isn't just bad for satisfaction scores—it's business suicide. Here's how to evolve your support strategy for the generation that drives 40% of global consumer spending.",

        "body": "**Who they are:**\n• **Gen Z**: Born 1997-2012 (ages 12-27)\n• **Millennials**: Born 1981-1996 (ages 28-43)\n• **Combined spending power**: $2.7 trillion annually\n• **DTC preference**: 67% prefer buying direct from brands vs. retailers\n\n**Their support expectations:**\n\n**1. Speed Over Perfection**\n• 87% prefer quick acknowledgment over perfect solutions\n• Would rather get a \"We're looking into this\" immediately than wait hours for a complete answer\n• Expect progress updates every 2-4 hours on complex issues\n• View 24+ hour response times as \"being ignored\"\n\n**2. Visual Communication**\n• Prefer screenshots, videos, and emojis over text walls\n• Send photos/videos to explain problems instead of detailed descriptions\n• Expect visual confirmations (\"Here's what we're doing...\")\n• Respond better to infographic-style explanations\n\n**3. Multi-Channel Consistency**\n• Start conversations on Instagram, continue via email, finish on chat\n• Expect support agents to have context across all channels\n• Get frustrated when they have to repeat information\n• Use social media as a primary customer service channel\n\n**4. Transparency and Authenticity**\n• Want to know the real reason behind delays or issues\n• Prefer honest explanations over corporate speak\n• Value brands that admit mistakes and show how they're fixing them\n• Expect personalized responses that acknowledge their individual situation\n\n**5. Self-Service First**\n• Try to solve problems themselves before contacting support\n• Expect comprehensive FAQs, video tutorials, and help centers\n• Want 24/7 access to order tracking and account management\n• Prefer chatbots for simple questions, humans for complex issues\n\n> **Reality check:** A 22-year-old customer who DMs your Instagram account at 9 PM expects either an immediate auto-response with helpful resources or a personal reply by 9 AM the next day. Anything longer feels like you don't care about their business."
