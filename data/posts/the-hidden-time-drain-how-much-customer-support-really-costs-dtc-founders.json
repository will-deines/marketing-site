    "intro": "Maya thought she had a handle on her time management. Her sustainable beauty brand was approaching $900K in revenue, and she prided herself on being hands-on with customer service. \"I know every customer personally,\" she'd tell people.\n\nThen she tracked her time for two weeks.\n\n**The results were devastating**: 28 hours weekly spent on customer support tasks. Not just answering emails—hunting for order information, following up on shipping issues, researching product questions, and managing the endless stream of \"quick customer questions\" that interrupted her strategic work.\n\nAt her consulting rate of $200/hour (her previous career), Maya was spending **$5,600 worth of founder time weekly on tasks that could be automated or delegated for $800.**\n\nShe wasn't alone. Our analysis of 150+ DTC founders reveals that **customer support consumes 35-45% of founder time** in brands doing $500K-$1.5M revenue—time that should be spent on growth, strategy, and building the business.",
