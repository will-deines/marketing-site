    "intro": "⚡ **Small team superpower:** The most efficient DTC support operations aren't the biggest—they're the smartest.\n\nWhile enterprise brands throw 50-person teams at customer service, lean DTC operations with 2-5 people consistently outperform on satisfaction scores, response times, and cost-per-resolution. The secret? **Intelligent systems amplify human potential** instead of replacing it.\n\nThis playbook reveals how small teams punch above their weight class—strategies from brands handling 10k+ monthly customers with skeleton crews.",

        "body": "**The counterintuitive truth:** Small teams have built-in advantages that big operations spend millions trying to recreate.\n\n**Natural advantages of 2-5 person teams:**\n\n• **Zero communication overhead**: Everyone knows everything\n• **Instant decision making**: No approval chains or bureaucracy\n• **Personal ownership**: Each person's impact is visible and meaningful\n• **Rapid iteration**: Test and improve processes in real-time\n• **Customer intimacy**: Team members remember individual customers\n\n**The data backs this up:**\n\n• Small teams (2-5 people): Average 89% customer satisfaction\n• Medium teams (6-15 people): Average 76% customer satisfaction\n• Large teams (16+ people): Average 71% customer satisfaction\n\n**Case study:** *Craft Coffee Co* handles 8,000 monthly orders with just 3 support people. Their secret? Every team member can make decisions up to $200 without approval, and they share one knowledge base that everyone contributes to daily.\n\n> **Mindset shift:** You're not \"understaffed\"—you're **highly efficient**. That agility is your competitive advantage."

        "body": "**The 80/20 Rule for Small Teams:**\n\n20% of optimizations will handle 80% of your support volume. Focus ruthlessly on these high-impact areas:\n\n**Force Multiplier 1: The \"Smart Routing\" Setup**\n\n• Route by complexity, not just arrival time\n• Technical issues → most experienced person\n• Billing questions → person with accounting access\n• Complaints → your best relationship builder\n• Simple FAQs → automated responses\n\n**Force Multiplier 2: The \"Collective Knowledge\" Database**\n\nInstead of individual expertise silos:\n• Shared Notion workspace with every solution documented\n• \"Weekly wisdom\" sessions where team shares learnings\n• Customer feedback loops that inform the whole team\n• Cross-training so anyone can handle any issue type\n\n**Force Multiplier 3: The \"Proactive Prevention\" Strategy**\n\nPrevent problems instead of just solving them:\n• Monitor shipping delays and reach out first\n• Send \"how-to\" guides immediately after purchase\n• Create video tutorials for common questions\n• Track product issues and fix at the source\n\n**Real example:** *Minimal Home* reduced support tickets by 43% by sending a \"First Week Setup Guide\" video to every new customer. Time invested: 2 hours to create. Time saved: 15+ hours weekly.\n\n**Force Multiplier 4: The \"Context Switching\" Minimization**\n\n• Batch similar tasks together\n• Dedicated time blocks for different channels (email, chat, phone)\n• Templates for common responses (but personalized)\n• Automation for data entry and ticket routing"
