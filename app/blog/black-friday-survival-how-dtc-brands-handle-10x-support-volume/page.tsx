    intro: `When Jessica's wellness brand sold 400 units during their best month ever, she felt ready for anything. Then Black Friday happened. **In 48 hours, they received 12,000 orders**—30 times their previous record. Her support inbox exploded with 2,400 tickets in two days. Her team of three was drowning.

Meanwhile, across the industry, successful DTC brands were thriving during the same chaos. **Black Friday 2024 generated $10.8 billion in U.S. online sales** (10.2% increase) and **$74.4 billion globally** (5% growth). The brands that survived—and thrived—weren't just lucky. They had systems.

The difference between peak season success and disaster isn't team size or budget. It's preparation, automation, and smart scalability strategies that turn overwhelming demand into profitable growth.`,
