Rachel's sustainable fashion brand was struggling with typical support economics: **$850 monthly cost** for handling 400+ customer inquiries, with zero revenue attribution. Her support team answered questions, processed returns, and sent polite "thank you" emails.

Then she discovered something that changed everything: **85% of service decision makers now expect their support teams to directly contribute to revenue**. Six months later, Rachel's support team generates **$12,400 monthly in additional revenue** through strategic upselling and cross-selling—a **1,458% ROI** on her support investment.

This isn't about aggressive sales tactics or pestering customers. It's about **smart relationship leveraging** that helps customers while growing revenue. The data is compelling: **72% of salespeople see revenue growth from upselling and cross-selling**, and companies implementing these strategies can see **up to 30% revenue increases**.
